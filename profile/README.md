## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
We're creating AppImages!

## What is AppImage ?
Linux apps that run anywhere

"As a user, I want to download an application from the original author, and run it on my Linux desktop system just like I would do with a Windows or Mac application."
"As an application author, I want to provide packages for Linux desktop systems, without the need to get it 'into' a distribution and without having to build for gazillions of different distributions."
